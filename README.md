## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis we have different loan requests and based on following informations provided to us in dataset we have to determine if it is healty loan (0) or high-risk loan (1). 

Information provided to us are: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory_marks and total debt. Goal is to predict loan_status to be healty(0) or high-risk loan(1).

Stages of the machine learning process:
I.Splitting the data into training and testing datasets
II.Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
    1.Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).
    2.Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model.
    3.Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following: Generate a confusion matrix & print the classification             report.
