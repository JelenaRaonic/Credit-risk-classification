In this Challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

There are 3 parts in this challenge:

1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
2. Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
